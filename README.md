### Some introduction about me
Hey there, Iâ€™m DanDoesCode, I like playing Android and PC games (at least i wish if i have a powerful computer that can run most games ðŸ˜­),
and helping people with useful codes that i made (at least... i wish if i can do that...)

Fun fact though, or... maybe i wont tell it for now, its secret, until my _personal issue_ has been resolved :)

<h6>someone probably might be asking me
<blockquote>why does your pfp looks similiar to someone that is suddenly vanished but there is no white lines, and the background tint is colored in blue?</blockquote>

actually... yeah i'm that person, its a long story to even explain here, but you should already seen the fun facts right?

so yeah you gotta wait for the answers, at least if someone came across this...</h6>
